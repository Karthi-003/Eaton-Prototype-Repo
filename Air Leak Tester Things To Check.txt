Things to be checked:
1. Need to confirm Whether test result is obtained for Multi test
   (This case we getting result data for every test but its not been logged due to case structure handled in code)
2. Check whether Result data is obatained only for 1st test?
   (In this case we need to try sending the command "I\S\RS232\Results=On" after completion of 1st test in order 
    to get results from 2nd test)

3. Need to Read the Current Active Program from I28 when new test is started
4. Need to check Test Evaluation string (A/R/BR/SB etc..) from Result Data after completion of every test. 




Queries
1. How much time will be taken to complete single test?
2. What will be the time taken to start 2nd test after completion of 1st test?
3. How does RS232 1 differ from RS232 2?


1.Check Test Evaluation codes and Program Evaluation code after completion of every test complete.
